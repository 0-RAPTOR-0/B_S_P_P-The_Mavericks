          <h2>Introduction to Dhaka Division</h2>
          <img src="Pictures/Bengal_gazetteer_1907-9.jpg" alt="">
          <p>Dhaka Division, at Bangladesh's heart, is a densely populated and dynamic region. [cite: 2, 3, 4, 5] It encompasses 13 districts, with Dhaka city as its vibrant, historic capital. [cite: 2, 3, 4, 5] This central hub pulsates with a rich past, a bustling present economy driven by garments and emerging tech, and a complex interplay of culture and environmental challenges. [cite: 2, 3, 4, 5] It's a land of immense human energy and significant national importance. [cite: 2, 3, 4, 5]</p>
          <p>The origins of the name Dhaka are uncertain. It may derive from the dhak tree, which was once common in the area, or from Dhakeshwari, the 'patron goddess' of the region.[6][7] Another popular theory states that Dhaka refers to a membranophone instrument, dhak which was played by order of Subahdar Islam Khan I during the inauguration of the Bengal capital in 1610.[8]

    Some references also say it was derived from a Prakrit dialect called Dhaka Bhasa; or Dhakka, used in the Rajtarangini for a watch station; or it is the same as Davaka, mentioned in the Allahabad pillar inscription of Samudragupta as an eastern frontier kingdom.[9] According to Rajatarangini written by a Kashmiri Brahman, Kalhana,[10] the region was originally known as Dhakka. The word Dhakka means watchtower. Bikrampur and Sonargaon—the earlier strongholds of Bengal rulers were situated nearby. So Dhaka was most likely used as the watchtower for the fortification purpose.[10]</p>
          <h3>Geographical Location and Area</h3>
          <p>Centrally situated in Bangladesh, Dhaka Division spans roughly between 23°30′N and 24°50'N latitude, and 90°00'E and 90°50'E longitude. [cite: 6, 7] Covering about 20,594 sq. km.</p>

          <h3>Number of Districts and Administrative Structure</h3>
          <p>Dhaka Division comprises 13 districts, each district is further divided into Upazilas (sub-districts), then Union Parishads (rural councils) or Wards (urban areas), and finally into villages or mahallas. [cite: 7, 8] The Dhaka Metropolitan Area has a distinct administrative structure with several thanas (police stations) and wards under the Dhaka North and Dhaka South City Corporations. Deputy commissioner
            A Deputy Commissioner (DC), popularly abbreviated to 'DC,' serves as the executive head of the district. Individuals appointed to the role are selected by the government from the Deputy Secretary BCS Administration Cadre.
            District councils
            Main article: District Councils of Bangladesh
            A district council (or zila parishad) is a local government body at the district level.[4] The Bengali word parishad means council and zila parishad translates to district council.
            
            The functions of a district council include the construction and maintenance of roads and bridges. They are also responsible for building hospitals, dispensaries, schools, and other educational institutions. In addition, district councils oversee health facilities and sanitation projects, as well as the installation of tube wells for drinking water. They also manage rest houses and coordinate activities among the Union Parishads within the district.</p>

          <h3>Population and Density</h3>
          <img src="Pictures/778381.png" alt="">
            <p>Dhaka Division is the most populous of the eight administrative divisions of Bangladesh.  According to recent estimates, the population of Dhaka Division is well over 40 million, making it one of the most densely populated regions in the world.    

                The Dhaka Metropolitan Area, which includes Dhaka city and its surrounding urban areas, is the primary contributor to this high population density.  Dhaka city itself is one of the fastest-growing megacities globally, with millions of people living within its boundaries. This rapid urbanization and migration from rural areas contribute to the extremely high population density.   
                
                The high population density in Dhaka Division presents both significant opportunities and challenges.    
                
                Opportunities: A large population provides a vast labor pool, a significant consumer market, and potential for economic growth and innovation.
                Challenges: The density also creates immense pressure on infrastructure, including housing, transportation, sanitation, and public services. It also contributes to environmental problems like pollution and congestion.
                To make this information even more robust, you would ideally include:
                
                Specific population figures: Instead of "well over 40 million," provide the most recent official population estimate. You can find this data from sources like the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) or the World Bank.
                Population density figures: Provide the population density in persons per square kilometer for Dhaka Division and, if possible, for the Dhaka Metropolitan Area. This will give a clearer picture of how crowded the region is.
                Comparison to other areas: You could add a comparison of Dhaka Division's population density to that of other major cities or regions globally to emphasize how high it is.
                Trends: Briefly mention the population growth rate and urbanization trends to explain why the density is so high.
                Where to find reliable data:
                
                Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS): This is the primary source for demographic and economic data within Bangladesh.
                World Bank: The World Bank provides data and statistics on various countries, including Bangladesh.
                United Nations Population Division: The UN provides global population data and projections.</p>

          <h3>Ancient and Medieval History</h3>
          <img src="Pictures/download.jpeg" alt=""> <img src="Pictures/gettyimages-1228577002-612x612.jpg" alt="">
          <p>Dhaka boasts a history stretching back centuries, evolving through various Sultanates before its pivotal rise in 1608. [cite: 13] As Jahangirnagar, the 17th-century capital of Mughal Bengal under Islam Khan, it witnessed significant urban growth, booming trade, and a vibrant cultural scene. [cite: 13]</p>
            <p>The earliest written mention of Dhaka occurs in a map in the book Décadas da Ásia (Decades of Asia) by Portuguese historian João de Barros. Dated 1550 CE, during the Sultanate period, it reads "Daca" in the present day region of Dhaka.[5] There is no definititive origin story of the name, but there are various theories:

                The name came following the establishment of Dhakeshwari temple built by Raja Ballal Sena in the 12th century and Dhakeswari is the name of Goddess Durga. Dhakeshwari may also mean Goddess of Dhaka; so the temple might have been named after the region.[citation needed]
                Dhak (a membranophone instrument) is used as part of the Durga Puja festival in this temple.[citation needed]
                The plant named Dhak (Butea monosperma) which was widely found in that area.[6]
                In the 4th century, the poet-laureate Harisena mentioned Davaka as an eastern frontier of the Gupta Empire, at Prayag Prashasti inscription on the Allahabad Pillar, as an eulogy for the Gupta Emperor Samudragupta.[7][5]
                Rajatarangini, written by a Kashmiri Brahman, Kalhana says the region was originally known as Dhakka. The word Dhakka means watchtower. Bikrampur and Sonargaon — the earlier strongholds of Bengal rulers were situated nearby. So Dhaka was likely used as the watchtower for the fortification purpose.[6]
                A dialect of Prakrit language is called Dhaka Bhasa.</p>

         <img src="Pictures/download (7).jpeg" alt="">
          <p>During British rule (mid-18th to mid-20th century), Dhaka remained a key administrative and commercial hub, even as Calcutta became the British Indian capital. [cite: 14, 15, 16] A significant moment was the 1905 Partition of Bengal, briefly making Dhaka the capital of Eastern Bengal and Assam, igniting political unrest. [cite: 14, 15, 16] Later, as the capital of East Pakistan (1947-1971), Dhaka became central to the growing movement for Bengali rights and autonomy. [cite: 14, 15, 16]</p>

          <p>In 1971, Dhaka was the heart of the Bangladesh Liberation War. [cite: 17, 18, 19, 20] The brutal crackdown on March 25th ignited the armed struggle, and the nation's independence was declared from here. [cite: 17, 18, 19, 20] The war culminated with the Pakistani forces' surrender in Dhaka on December 16th, marking Bangladesh's birth. [cite: 17, 18, 19, 20] The city holds numerous memorials to this pivotal time.</p>
